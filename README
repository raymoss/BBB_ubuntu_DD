This repo is for tracking the progress of development of device drviers on beagle bone black.
Current goals:
1. Setup the router for assigning a static ip to the board sot that it can be configured from any where in the world.
2. Create a script and cron job which will peridically check if the public ip is changed or not. If it is changed then it will send a mail to raymogg account.
3. Build tty driver on the board and check its functionality.
4. Build usb-serial driver on the board and check its functionality.
