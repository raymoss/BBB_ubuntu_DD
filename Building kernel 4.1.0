Things i did in 2 weekends:
1. Install the latest kernel from linux torvald github. 4.1.0 
2 methods ,first using github :- git clone -b v4.1 https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
2nd methods download from zip file.

3. Apply patch from this site https://rcn-ee.com/deb/xenial-armhf/v4.1.18-ti-r52/ command patch -p1 < patch......file

4.  make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- BBB_defconfig 
Copy BBB_defconfig to this location arch/arm/configs/ which in turn is copied from https://rcn-ee.com/deb/xenial-armhf/v4.1.18-ti-r52/

5. make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- uImage dtbs LOADADDR=0x80008000 -j4

After compiling you can find the image files in “arch/arm/boot/” directory. Copy “uImage” file from this directory and also “am335x-boneblack.dtb” file from “arch/arm/boot/dts/” directory to the BOOT partition.

6. sudo make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- -j4 modules
   sudo make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/media/mani/RFS/ modules_install
 
7. Copy uEnv.txt,MLO from boot and copy it boot partition of sdcard.

8.After this unsuccessfull attempts i started with the steps at https://eewiki.net/display/linuxonarm/BeagleBone#BeagleBone and got a working kernel.
9. For filesystem i used the one at rcenet ftp and extracted the image using kpartx command. 
10. later there was an issue of preserving the links of the files.
 this got resolved using cp -P -r ... command.
11. Next there was an issue with sudo permission. I mounted the filesystem again and directly editted the permission of the file.
